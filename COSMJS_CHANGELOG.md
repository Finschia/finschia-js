# CHANGELOG

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.27.1] - 2022-01-26

### Added

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add `fromBinary`/`toBinary` to convert between
  JavaScript objects and the JSON representation of `cosmwasm_std::Binary`
  (base64).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Export `WasmExtension` and `setupWasmExtension`.
- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: Added `LedgerSigner.showAddress` and
  `LaunchpadLedger.showAddress` to show the user's address in the Ledger screen.

### Changed

- @cosmjs/stargate: The error messages for missing types in `AminoTypes` now
  contain the type that was searched for ([#990]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Change the `Evidence` type to `any` and avoid decoding
  it. The structure we had before was outdated and trying to decode it led to
  exceptions at runtime when a block with actual values was encountered.
  ([#980])

[#980]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/980

## [0.27.0] - 2022-01-10

### Added

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add `hash` field to `BroadcastTxAsyncResponse`
  ([#938]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `denomMetadata` and `denomsMetadata` to `BankExtension`
  ([#932]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Merge `DeliverTxFailure` and `DeliverTxSuccess` into a
  single `DeliverTxResponse` ([#878], [#949]). Add `assertIsDeliverTxFailure`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Created initial `MintExtension`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Created `types.Dec` decoder function
  `decodeCosmosSdkDecFromProto`.
- @cosmjs/amino: Added `StdTx`, `isStdTx` and `makeStdTx` and removed them from
  @cosmjs/launchpad. They are re-exported in @cosmjs/launchpad for backwards
  compatibility.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `GasPrice.toString`.

[#878]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/878
[#949]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/949

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add missing `BlockSearchResponse` case to `Response`.

### Changed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Remove verified queries from `AuthExtension` and
  `BankExtension` as well as `StargateClient.getAccountVerified` because the
  storage layout is not stable across multiple Cosmos SDK releases. Verified
  queries remain available in the `IbcExtension` because for IBC the storage
  layout is standardized. Such queries can still be implemented in CosmJS caller
  code that only needs to support one backend. ([#865])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove default URL from `HttpClient` and
  `WebsocketClient` constructors ([#897]).
- all: Upgrade cosmjs-types to 0.4. This includes the types of the Cosmos SDK
  0.44 modules x/authz and x/feegrant. It causes a few breaking changes by
  adding fields to interfaces as well as changing `Date` to a `Timestamp`
  object. ([#928])
- @cosmjs/stargate and @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add simulation support
  ([#931]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove `Tendermint33Client` and related symbols.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add support for wasmd 0.21. This changes the AMINO
  JSON representation of `Msg{Execute,Instantiate,Migrate}Contract.msg` from
  base64 strings to JSON objects. ([#948])
- @cosmjs/cli: Replace `colors` dependency with `chalk` (see
  https://snyk.io/blog/open-source-npm-packages-colors-faker/)

## [0.26.6] - 2022-01-10

### Changed

- @cosmjs/cli: Replace `colors` dependency with `chalk` (see
  https://snyk.io/blog/open-source-npm-packages-colors-faker/)

## [0.26.5] - 2021-11-20

### Added

- @cosmjs/amino: The `coin` and `coins` helpers now support both `number` and
  `string` as input types for the amount. This is useful if your values exceed
  the safe integer range.

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Fix undefined `this` in `decodeBroadcastTxAsync` and
  `broadcastTxAsync` ([#937]).

[#937]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/937

## [0.26.4] - 2021-10-28

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Fix response error handling for smart queries.

## [0.26.3] - 2021-10-25

### Added

- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: Add support for using forks of the Cosmos Ledger app by
  adding the fields `LaunchpadLedgerOptions.ledgerAppName` and
  `.minLedgerAppVersion`.

### Deprecated

- @cosmjs/stargate: The verified queries from `AuthExtension` and
  `BankExtension` as well as `StargateClient.getAccountVerified` are deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.27 ([#910]).

[#910]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/910

## [0.26.2] - 2021-10-12

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: remove extra space in messageTimeout registry.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Fix Amino JSON representation of
  `MsgInstantiateContract`, `MsgMigrateContract` and `MsgExecuteContract` to
  match the wasmd expectation. This was broken since the wasmd upgrade to
  Stargate such that no Ledger signing was possible for those message types in
  the meantime.

## [0.26.1] - 2021-09-30

### Added

- @cosmjs/amino: `decodeBech32Pubkey` and `decodeAminoPubkey` now support
  decoding multisig public keys ([#882]).

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Add missing pagination key arguments to query types in
  `GovExtension`.

[#882]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/882

## [0.26.0] - 2021-08-24

### Added

  `parseCoins` that replaces the `parseCoins` re-export from `@cosmjs/amino`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Export `isValidBuilder`, which is a clone of
  `isValidBuilder` from @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Copy symbols `Code`, `CodeDetails`, `Contract`,
  `ContractCodeHistoryEntry` and `JsonObject` from @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad
  and remove dependency on @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad.
- @cosmjs/faucet: Add new configuration variable `FAUCET_PATH_PATTERN` to
  configure the HD path of the faucet accounts ([#832]).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add field `ibcPortId` to `Contract` ([#836]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `GovExtension` for query client.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add support for `MsgDeposit`, `MsgSubmitProposal` and

  be calculated and passed to `SigningStargateClient` when calling any methods
  which submit transactions to the blockchain.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `tendermint34.Header.lastBlockId` and
  `tendermint34.Block.lastCommit` optional to better handle the case of height 1
  where there is no previous block.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: `makeAuthInfoBytes` now takes an array of pubkey
  sequence pairs in order to support different sequences for different signers.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Upgraded client to support wasmd 0.18 backends.
  Other backends are not supported anymore. Update proto types from
  `cosmwasm.wasm.v1beta1.*` to `cosmwasm.wasm.v1.*`. `MsgStoreCode.source` and
  `MsgStoreCode.builder` were removed; `MsgInstantiateContract.initMsg` and
  `MsgMigrateContract.migrateMsg` were renamed to `msg`; `Code.{source,builder}`

  `DirectSecp256k1HdWalletOptions` argument which includes an array of `hdPaths`
  instead of a single `hdPath`. `DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.generate` now also
  accepts options via this interface. This adds support for multiple accounts
  from the same mnemonic to `DirectSecp256k1HdWallet`.

- @cosmjs/launchpad: Export distribution module msg types
  `MsgFundCommunityPool`, `MsgSetWithdrawAddress`, `MsgWithdrawDelegatorReward`,
  `MsgWithdrawValidatorCommission` and type checker helper functions.
- @cosmjs/utils: Added `assertDefinedAndNotNull`.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: The new `Tendermint34Client` is a copy of the old
  `Client` but without the automatic version detection. Its usage is encouraged
  over `Client` if you connect to a Tendermint 0.34 backend.

### Changed

- @cosmjs/encoding: Change return type of `fromRfc3339` from `ReadonlyDate` to
  `Date` as the caller becomes the owner of the object and can safely mutate it
  in any way.
- @cosmjs/launchpad-ledger: Renamed to @cosmjs/ledger-amino.
- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: `LedgerSigner.sign` method renamed `signAmino`.

### Deprecated

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Deprecate `DateTime` in favour of the free functions
  `fromRfc3339WithNanoseconds` and `toRfc3339WithNanoseconds`.

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Rename `FeeTable` type to `CosmWasmFeeTable`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: `SigningCosmWasmClient` constructor now takes optional
  arguments `gasPrice` and `gasLimits` instead of `customFees` for easier
  customization.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Rename `SigningCosmWasmClient.signAndPost` method to
  `.signAndBroadcast`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Use stricter type `Record<string, unknown>` for smart query,

- @cosmjs/demo-staking: Remove package and supporting scripts.
- @cosmjs/encoding: Add `limit` parameter to `Bech32.encode` and `.decode`. The
  new default limit for decoding is infinity (was 90 before). Set it to 90 to
  create a strict decoder.

  `FAUCET_GAS_PRICE` and now only accepts one token. Environmental variable
  `FAUCET_GAS` renamed to `FAUCET_GAS_LIMIT`.
- @cosmjs/faucet: `/credit` API now expects `denom` (base token) instead of
  `ticker` (unit token). Environmental variables specifying credit amounts now
  need to use uppercase denom.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `FeeTable` type to `CosmosFeeTable` and export a new
  more generic type `FeeTable`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Add new class `GasPrice`, new helper type `GasLimits` and
  new helper function `buildFeeTable` for easier handling of gas prices and
  fees.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `CosmosClient.postTx` method to `.broadcastTx`.

  `isSearchBySentFromOrToQuery` and `isSearchByTagsQuery`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Change type of `TxsResponse.logs` and
  `BroadcastTxsResponse.logs` to `unknown[]`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Export `StdSignDoc` and create helpers to make and
  serialize a `StdSignDoc`: `makeSignDoc` and `serializeSignDoc`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Let `OfflineSigner.sign` take an `StdSignDoc` instead of an
  encoded message and return a `SignResponse` that includes the document which
  was signed.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Remove `PrehashType` and the prehash type argument in
  `OfflineSigner.sign` because the signer now needs to know how to serialize an
  `StdSignDoc`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Remove `makeSignBytes` in favour of `makeSignDoc` and
  `serializeSignDoc`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Create `WrappedTx`, `WrappedStdTx` and `isWrappedStdTx` to
  better represent the Amino tx interface. Deprecate `CosmosSdkTx`, which is an
  alias for `WrappedStdTx`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Add `makeStdTx` to create an `StdTx`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `Secp256k1Wallet` to `Secp256k1HdWallet`. Later on,
  we'll use `Secp256k1Wallet` for single key wallets.

  Launchpad. Two new classes are provided: `LedgerSigner` (for most use cases)
  and `LaunchpadLedger` for more fine-grained access.
- @cosmjs/math: Add `.multiply` method to `Decimal` class.
- @cosmjs/math: Deprecate `Uint32.fromBigEndianBytes` in favour of
  `Uint32.fromBytes`, which supports both big and little endian.

  `Uint64.fromBytes`, which supports both big and little endian.
- @cosmjs/math: Add `Uint32.fromString`.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `BroadcastTxCommitResponse.height` non-optional.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `TxProof.proof.leafHash` non-optional because it
  is always set.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Change type of `GenesisResponse.appState` to
  `Record<string, unknown> | undefined`.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove obsolete `TxData.tags` and make `TxData.events`
  non-optional. Rename `Tag` to `Attribute`.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove obsolete `BlockResultsResponse.beginBlock` and
  `.beginBlock`. The new `.beginBlockEvents` and `.endBlockEvents` now parse the
  events correctly.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove trivial helpers `getTxEventHeight`,
  `getHeaderEventHeight` and `getBlockEventHeight` because they don't do
  anything else than accessing an object member.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add support for connecting to Tendermint RPC 0.34.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `TxEvent.index` optional and deprecate it because
  it is not set anymore in Tendermint 0.34.

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Remove `RestClient` class in favour of new modular
  `LcdClient` class from @cosmjs/sdk38.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Add `SigningCosmWasmClient.signAndPost` as a mid-level
  abstraction between `SigningCosmWasmClient.upload`/`.instantiate`/`.execute`
  and `.postTx`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Use `*PostTx*` types and helpers from @cosmjs/sdk38. Remove
  exported `PostTxResult`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: `ContractDetails` was removed in favour of just `Contract`.
  The missing `init_msg` is now available via the contract's code history (see
  `getContractCodeHistory`).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Remove `SigningCallback` in favour of the `OfflineSigner`
  interface.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Rename `CosmosClient.getNonce` method to `.getSequence`.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Remove `RestClient` class in favour of new modular `LcdClient`
  class.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Remove `Pen` type in favour of `OfflineSigner` and remove
  `Secp256k1Pen` class in favour of `Secp256k1Wallet` which takes an
  `OfflineSigner` instead of a `SigningCallback`.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Rename `CosmosSdkAccount` to `BaseAccount` and export the type.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `BaseAccount` now uses `number | string` as the type for
  `account_number` and `sequence`. The new helpers `uint64ToNumber` and
  `uint64ToString` allow you to normalize the mixed input.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `BaseAccount` now uses `string | PubKey | null` as the type for
  `public_key`. The new helper `normalizePubkey` allows you to normalize the
  mixed input.
- @cosmjs/math: Add missing integer check to `Uint64.fromNumber`. Before
  `Uint64.fromNumber(1.1)` produced some result.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Add `SigningCosmosClient.signAndPost` as a mid-level
  abstraction between `SigningCosmosClient.sendTokens` and `.postTx`.

  `isPostTxFailure`/`isPostTxSuccess`; export `assertIsPostTxSuccess`.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `Secp256k1Wallet`s can now be generated randomly with
  `Secp256k1Wallet.generate(n)` where `n` is 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 mnemonic
  words.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: The new `Secp256k1Wallet.serialize` and `.deserialize` allow
  encrypted serialization of the wallet.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Remove the obsolete `upload`, `init`, `exec` properties from
  `FeeTable`. @cosmjs/cosmwasm has its own `FeeTable` with those properties.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Rename package to @cosmjs/launchpad.
